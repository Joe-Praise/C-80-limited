## Getting Started

Hello, welcome to BatMan's lair!

i'm Praise Joseph, but be sure to call me Joe.

Welcome to my coding submittion challenge from C80 Limited...üçæ

Aiit, lets get back shall we...

This was a challenge to build one of the most beautiful looking dashboard i've seen in a while.(Whomever designed this is Goated!)

Tech stack i used on the project were

- Nextjs & React
- Tailwind css
- Shadcn ui for charts
- Typescript to ensure its strictly typed
- Axios & Tanstack for API calls
- Lucide react for a limited number of icons

Personal Goal going into this

- I had not used linear gradient on a line chart before. i pride myself for getting that into the books (hehe);
- I tried to make the code easy to read
- Yeah, also to ace the task (hopefully i make it and work with the mastermind behind the ui);

I hope this put a smile on your face at least, thank you for reading dearly beloved.

One last thing, The dataset just be producing flat lines. Thought of changing things but i'd just leave it at that. Thank you!.

Till i push again.

Adios!
